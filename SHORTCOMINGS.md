## Language Shortcomings

As one of three major proof assistants, including Coq (1989) and Isabelle (1986), Lean has a lot going for it. However, with Lean (2013) being the newest of the three there are some notable pain points.

### Resistance, *or lack thereof*, to Change

Each major version of the Lean programming language is less than a decade of age apart from the next. Usually innovation isn't a problem, but lack of backwards compatibility between major versions certainly is. Lean 3 (2017) was only 4 years older than Lean 1 at release and was declared end-of-life by its original developers as soon development of Lean 4 (2021) began.

If you are a mathematical researcher, it may be advisable to use an older proof assistant with more documentation, prior work examples and a more established academic community. Assuming you are working with Lean 4 now, the inception of Lean 5 may happen before your research comes to fruition.
